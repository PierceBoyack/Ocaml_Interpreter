# Ocaml_Interpreter
 
An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

This Ocaml interpreter takes advantage of the algebraic data types and pattern matching abilities of that language to build a basic interpreter.  It is capable of making first class functions, and conditionals and has its own stack and memory management system.

The final line of interpreter.ml shows how to use I/O to feed a program into the interpreter.  The Test_Input folder contains some test inputs to try out the execution of the interpreter.
